# /voice: English Accent Detection and Correction Demo

Hi there, I'm excited to share my work on the `/voice` feature with you! While I'm unable to share the underlying source code due to certain restrictions, I've set up a live demo that showcases its capabilities.

## Live Demo

The demo is designed to detect your accent when speaking English and provide corrective feedback to help you achieve a standard English accent. You can experience it live here: [www.devCarlitos.xyz](http://www.devCarlitos.xyz)

## About /voice

I developed `/voice` along side [Andrea Aguilera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-aguilera9/) and [Aldrich Lapid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aldrichgranlapid/) with the goal of helping people refine their spoken English toward a standard accent. The demo works by:
- **Detecting Your Accent:** It listens to your spoken English, analyzes the nuances, and identifies deviations from the standard accent.
- **Providing Correction:** It offers personalized suggestions on how to adjust your pronunciation.

To achieve this, I integrated ChatGPT as the underlying language model (LLM). I've cross-trained ChatGPT with AI data specifically focused on user accent characteristics. This specialized training allows it to interpret accent data accurately and provide meaningful feedback tailored to your needs.

## How It Works

1. **Record Your Speech:** Visit the live demo and follow the instructions to record your spoken English.
2. **Accent Analysis:** The system processes your speech. ChatGPT, enhanced with accent-specific training, analyzes the data to determine how closely your accent aligns with a standard English accent.
3. **Feedback & Suggestions:** Based on the analysis, you'll receive detailed suggestions and guidance on improving your pronunciation.

## Feedback & Contact

Thank you for your interest in my work. I hope you find the demo both fun and helpful as you work toward mastering a standard English accent!
